## Installation

1. Move, copy or link the folder you downloaded to ~/.local/share/gedit/plugins/addiks-phpide
2. Restart gedit if it is running.
3. In the menu, go to: Edit > Settings > Plugins

## Set up for project

To be able to use any of the features included in this plugin on your PHP-project,
you first have to build the project-index for this projct. This is done by using the Menu 'PHP' > 'Build index'.
A new window should pop up showing you the progress of the build. Once the index is built,
you are good to go using this plugin.

The PHP-menu will only be visible when having a PHP-file open in gedit.
Also make sure that this file is in the project you want to index.

If your project is including external libraries or is generating code which is not part of your codebase or libraries,
you probably want to configure the index-includes and excludes before building the index.
You can also do this afterwards and update the index, but it is faster to configure the project beforehand.
